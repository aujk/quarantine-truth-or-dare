# truth-or-dare
Simple quarantine compatible truth or dare generator 

Truths or dares can be added to `src/data/gameList.json` 

Temporarily hosted at https://master.d26mf4yrry5w0.amplifyapp.com/ 

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Game Instructions 

1. Either clone repository and run `yarn start` or click [here](https://master.d26mf4yrry5w0.amplifyapp.com). 
2. Share your screen with your friends, or have all players follow Step 1. 
3. Select the mode you'd like to play in (Friendly, Flirty, or Mixed). 
4. Have players take turns answering the truths or dares that are generated with each click of the Truth or Dare button.

### Notes:
- The game can be played between two people or in a group. Truths or dares may repeat. If a player receives a duplicate truth or dare, he or she can skip over it. 

### Potential extensions: 
- Create "game sessions" for groups of players so that everyone in the same session can see the same screen without screen sharing. 
- Have users enter players' names and have the respective player for completing a truth or dare's name displayed on the screen.
- Randomly assign a "truth or dare deliverer" and a "truth or dare receiver" for each turn (depedent on the above extension).
- Check box enabling "drinking mode" to receive drinking-related dares.
